# React State Task

## Create a react app that lets the user make a list. Make sure it:

- Includes an input field to allow the user to add item
- Displays the full list of items that dynamically changes as user enters more items

_You can use the code sekelton in "App.js" to get started._

**Hint**: useState can take in a "list", or array of objects, which can be updated with user input.

**BONUS**: You can add a "mark as complete" feature to mark each item as complete.
